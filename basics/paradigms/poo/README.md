OOP based on two requirements, that is capability to model problem
in objects, and its support of few principles of modularity and
code reuse

1. a language must enable a developer to describe
the reality using objects:
- association :object with capability to refer another independent object
- aggregation: object with capability to embed one or more independent object
- composition: object with capability to embed one or more dependent object

2. if the language support these principles:
- encapsulation: concentrate in a single entity
- inheritance: acquires some or all feature from one or more objects
- polymorphism: capability to process objects based on their data type or structure
