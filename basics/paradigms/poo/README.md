- first to see objects folder in this repo, to understand objects

oop - definition
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DefinitionsForOo

OOP based on two requirements:
1. that is capability to model problem in objects
2.  and its support of few principles of modularity and
code reuse

1. a language must enable a developer to describe
the reality using objects:
- association :object with capability to refer another independent object
- aggregation: object with capability to embed one or more independent object
- composition: object with capability to embed one or more dependent object

2. if the language support these principles:
- encapsulation: concentrate in a single entity
- inheritance: acquires some or all feature from one or more objects
- polymorphism: capability to process objects based on their data type or structure

Questions:
what is oop?
- is javascript object oriented?
However, we can see that our informal definition make no explicit reference to classes.
Features and principles are required for objects. Classes are not a real requirement, but they
are sometimes a convenient way to abstract sets of objects with common properties. So, a
language can be Object Oriented if it supports objects even without classes, as in JavaScript.
