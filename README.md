Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs (Prentice-Hall)

binary search three (BST)

Studying algorithms is important because there is always more than one algorithm that
can be used to solve a problem, and knowing which ones are the most efficient is im‐
portant for the productive programmer. For example, there are at least six or seven ways
to sort a list of data, but knowing that the Quicksort algorithm is more efficient than
the selection sort algorithm will lead to a much more efficient sorting process. Or that
it’s fairly easy to implement a sequential or linear search algorithm for a list of data, but
knowing that the binary sort algorithm can sometimes be twice as efficient as the se‐
quential search will lead to a better program.
